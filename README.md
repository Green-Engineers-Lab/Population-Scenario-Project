# ITMoB Training Seminar Series #1: Modeling on Population Distribution Projection for Scenario Analysis
ITMoB launched a series of open online training seminars as an opportunity for technical capacity building.
The first training seminar on population distribution modeling will be organized on 3rd September.
The program is designed for researchers and students who want to obtain the modeling skills for scenario analysis on population distribution.

Date: 3rd September (Friday)

Time: 15:00-17:00 in Japan time（14:00-16:00 in Philippines time, 13:00-15:00 in Western Indonesian time）
